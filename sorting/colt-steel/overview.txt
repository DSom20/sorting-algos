Bubble,Selection,Insertion

The quadratic sorts

All worst (and average case) are O(n^2)

For best case (nearly sorted):

  Bubble sort can be O(n) if use optimized version where terminate early if 
    an iteration doesn't have any swaps
      (Would want to add new item, (ie have unsorted element) at beginning)
  Insertion sort can be O(n)
    (If know list is already sorted, could add item to end and optimize by just
    running that inner loop subroutine from the last element...)
